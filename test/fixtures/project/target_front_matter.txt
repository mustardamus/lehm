target: dist/{{fileName}}.txt
sampleString: This is a sample string
---

When the template yaml-front-matter has a 'target' field, that is used to
determine the path in the project folder where the parsed template is written.
{{fileName}} will be requested from the user and can be used in the content
(this text) as well. Same for other front-matter defined variables like
{{sampleString}}.

Note that all variables in the 'target' value will be requested no matter if
they were defined in other templates. On the other hand, variables defined in
other templates can be reused and will have the same value as answered by the
user, like {{sampleBoolean}} or {{anotherSampleString}}.
