This file has a yaml-front-matter that will be parsed before parsing the content
(this text). Since it does not have a 'target' field in the front-matter, the
same file name will be used to write the file to the project folder.

You can use variables from the front-matter like so {{sampleString}}, but also
can introduce other variables like {{anotherSampleString}} which also will be
requested by the user if not already set by the front-matter.

Lists defined in the front matter can be used like this:

{{#sampleStringArray}}
  - {{.}}
{{/sampleStringArray}}

{{#sampleObjectArray}}
  - {{id}}: {{name}} (note that variables inside list loops are not requested)
{{/sampleObjectArray}}
