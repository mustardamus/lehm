# Comments

Handlebars comments without any '=' or '#' inside will not be processed.
So {{! this comment doesn't do anything }}.

# Variable Comments

If a Handlebars comment has a '=' and/or '#' inside, it will be parsed as
variable declaration that declares the name and the default value and/or
the description for the variable.

{{! sampleString # This is a description for the sampleString variable, with no default value }}

{{! defaultValue = Default value for the defaultValue variable (a string), no description }}

{{! defaultValueWithDesc = true # this variable has a default value (a boolean) and a description }}

{{! aNumber = 13 # this should be parsed as a number }}
