This is a template in a sub-folder. It also can declare new variables like
{{ declaredInSub }} or use
already declared variables like {{ sampleString }}.

You may also set the default value and/or description of a already declared
variable. Works only if it has not been set in another template before. For
example, the {{ sampleString }} has no default value. It now has with:
{{! sampleString = works }}
