# Comments

Handlebars comments without any '=' or '#' inside will not be processed.
So {{! this comment doesn't do anything }}.


# Variable Declaration Comments

If a Handlebars comment has a '=' and/or '#' inside, it will be parsed as
variable declaration that declares the name and the default value and/or
the description for the variable.

{{! sampleString # This is a description for the sampleString variable, with no default value }}

{{! defaultValue = Default value for the defaultValue variable (a string), no description }}

{{! defaultValueWithDesc = true # this variable has a default value (a boolean) and a description }}

{{! aNumber = 13 # this should be parsed as a number }}


# Variable Usage

Now you can use a declared variable from above like so:
{{ defaultValueWithDesc }}.

However, if a variable has not been declared you can do so just using it in your
template like so: {{ justDeclared }}. The {{ justDeclared }} variable can then
be re-used, however, it has no default value or description and will be
requested from the user as a string.

Further you can use helpers to modify the variable value like so:
{{ lowerCase sampleString }} with a declared variable, or
{{ snakeCase playSnake }} with a newly declared variable.
