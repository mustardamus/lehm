# Lehm - a file-generator that gets out of your way

Lehm is a command-line file-generator that aims to get out of your way. Write
templates and generate files from them without configuring a thing or writing
any code.

It's build on Handlebars.js and has simple hooks with access to Inquirer.js,
Shell.js, Fs-Extra and Lodash, which makes it very extendible.

Generate single files, a bunch of them or scaffold whole projects with
installation and all.
