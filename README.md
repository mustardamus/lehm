# Lehm - a file-generator that gets out of your way

Lehm is a command-line file-generator that aims to get out of your way. Write
templates and generate files from them without configuring a thing or writing
any code.

It's build on [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com) and has simple hooks
with access to [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js),
[Shell.js](https://github.com/shelljs/shelljs),
[Fs-Extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra) and
[Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs), which makes it very extendible.

Generate single files, a bunch of them or scaffold whole projects with
installation and all.
